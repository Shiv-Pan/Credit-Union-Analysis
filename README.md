# üìä Credit Union Lending Case Study ‚Äì Spring 2025

**Course:** Intermediate Accounting II (BUS1 121B)  
**Institution:** San Jos√© State University  
**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world lending decision for BNB Credit Union, requiring students to assess the financial condition of a prospective borrower‚ÄîPCI (Precision Components Inc.). Our team was tasked with analyzing the company's original and updated financial statements, proposing adjusting journal entries, recalculating key ratios, and evaluating ethical considerations involved in the loan approval process.

## üîç Key Deliverables
- **Original and Updated Financial Analysis:** Evaluated PCI‚Äôs financial position using provided income statements, balance sheets, and supporting tables. Applied adjusting entries based on GAAP to develop revised financials.
- **Correcting Entries (Q2):** Identified and recorded appropriate adjustments for errors or policy misapplications, aligning with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
- **Ratio Analysis (Q1 & Q4):** Recalculated profitability, liquidity, and solvency ratios to assess the company‚Äôs financial health pre- and post-adjustments. Interpretation focused on how these changes impacted loan decision-making.
- **Iterative Scenario Testing:** Used iterative data to explore how varying assumptions or estimates affected PCI‚Äôs financial outlook and borrowing risk.
- **Ethical Considerations (Q5 & Q6):** Addressed ethical dilemmas surrounding financial misstatements, transparency, and loan officer responsibilities. Drafted a formal recommendation on whether BNB should approve PCI‚Äôs loan, supported by both financial and ethical reasoning.

## üß† Learning Outcomes
- Applied intermediate accounting knowledge to a full-cycle case involving journal entries, statement preparation, ratio interpretation, and ethics.
- Strengthened financial literacy by working through multiple iterations of PCI‚Äôs financials.
- Gained experience in balancing hard data with ethical business judgment, preparing for real-world roles in accounting, finance, and credit risk assessment.
